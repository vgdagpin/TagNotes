# Project Context: TagNotes

## Overview
TagNotes is a monorepo-style project built with Vite, React (TypeScript), and includes a server (Node.js/Express style), Netlify serverless functions, and shared code. It is structured for both frontend and backend development, supporting modern web app workflows.

## Main Folders and Files

- **client/**: Main React frontend app
  - `App.tsx`: Main app component
  - `global.css`: Global styles (likely Tailwind CSS)
  - `components/ui/`: UI components (accordion, button, dialog, etc.)
  - `hooks/`: Custom React hooks
  - `lib/`: Utility functions and tests
  - `pages/`: Page-level React components (Index, NotFound)
- **server/**: Backend Node.js server
  - `index.ts`: Main server entry point
  - `node-build.ts`: Build script for server
  - `routes/`: API route handlers (e.g., demo.ts)
- **shared/**: Shared code between client and server
  - `api.ts`: Likely shared API types or logic
- **netlify/functions/**: Netlify serverless functions
  - `api.ts`: Serverless API handler
- **public/**: Static assets (favicon, robots.txt, etc.)

## Root Files
- `index.html`: Main HTML entry for Vite
- `package.json`: Project scripts and dependencies
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `vite.config.ts`, `vite.config.server.ts`: Vite config for client/server
- `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.js`: Tailwind and PostCSS config
- `netlify.toml`: Netlify deployment config
- `components.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`: Miscellaneous/project-specific files

## Scripts (from package.json)
- `dev`: Start Vite dev server
- `build`: Build the project
- `start`: Start the server (may require build first)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `pnpm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev`
3. For backend/server: `npm run start` (after build)
4. For Netlify functions: Use Netlify CLI (`netlify dev`)

## Technologies Used
- React (TypeScript)
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js (server)
- Netlify Functions

## Notes
- The project is modular, with clear separation between frontend, backend, and shared code.
- UI components are organized for reusability.
- Netlify functions allow for serverless API endpoints.
- Shared code enables DRY principles between client and server.
